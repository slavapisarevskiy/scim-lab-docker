PingFederate Connection Export XML Examples
-------------------------------------------

The files "idp-connection.xml" and "sp-connection.xml" are XML documents 
that serve as examples of individual SAML 2.0 connections exported from the 
PingFederate administrative console.

The XML elements within these files are annotated with comments. 
By examining the structure and contents of these files, PingFederate 
administrators can gain the knowledge necessary to make changes to
exported connections. A modified connection can then be imported into
PingFederate as a new connection using the Connection Import Web Service.

Please refer the PingFederate Administrator's Manual for more information.
